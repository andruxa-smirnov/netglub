# netglub

netglub is an open source OSINT framework.

### Authors

This repository is a fork of
[www.netglub.org](http://www.netglub.org) from the original authors at [Diateam](http://www.diateam.net/)

### Changes

some small changes I have done so far:

+ I have updated the source and build files to be compatible with modern versions of graphviz
+ build files have been enhanced for other linux build environments (e.g. Debian testing)

I just leave this here for others until I can test the whole framework. For now
I was able to build all three components with Debian testing.

### License

The original authors distributed netglub as GPLv3. The same license applies here.
